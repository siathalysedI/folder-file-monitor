## Installation

### Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siathalysedI/folder-file-monitor/main/install_folder_file_monitor.sh | bash
```

**You will be asked to specify which directories you want to monitor. You can add multiple directories.**

### Option 2: Installation with Specific Directory

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siathalysedI/folder-file-monitor/main/install_folder_file_monitor.sh | bash -s "/path/to/your/directory"
```

### Option 3: Manual Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   brew install fswatch
   ```

2. **Create directories:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/Scripts ~/Logs ~/Library/LaunchAgents

WHERE datetime(timestamp) >= datetime('now', '-24 hours') 
  AND event_type = 'CREATED'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;"

# Most active files by event type with full paths
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
SELECT 
    filepath, 
    event_type,
    COUNT(*) as occurrences, 
    MAX(timestamp) as last_occurrence
FROM file_changes 
WHERE event_type IN ('CREATED', 'MODIFIED', 'DELETED')
GROUP BY filepath, event_type 
ORDER BY occurrences DESC, last_occurrence DESC
LIMIT 15;"

# Daily statistics with event breakdown
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
SELECT 
    date(timestamp) as date, 
    COUNT(*) as total_changes,
    COUNT(DISTINCT filepath) as unique_files,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'CREATED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as created,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'MODIFIED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as modified,
    SUM(CASE WHEN event_type = 'DELETED' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as deleted,
    MIN(timestamp) as first_change,
    MAX(timestamp) as last_change
FROM file_changes 
GROUP BY date(timestamp) 
ORDER BY date DESC 
LIMIT 7;"

# Files that were created and then deleted
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
SELECT DISTINCT c.filepath, c.timestamp as created_at, d.timestamp as deleted_at
FROM file_changes c
JOIN file_changes d ON c.filepath = d.filepath
WHERE c.event_type = 'CREATED' 
  AND d.event_type = 'DELETED'
  AND datetime(c.timestamp) < datetime(d.timestamp)
ORDER BY c.timestamp DESC;"
```

## Enhanced Maintenance

### Clean Old Records with Verification

```bash
# Check database size before cleanup
du -h ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records FROM file_changes;"

# Delete records older than 90 days
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
DELETE FROM file_changes 
WHERE datetime(timestamp) < datetime('now', '-90 days');"

# Optimize database with enhanced indexing
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "VACUUM;"

# Verify cleanup
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as remaining_records FROM file_changes;"
```

### Enhanced Database Analysis

```bash
# View database statistics
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    COUNT(DISTINCT filepath) as unique_files,
    MIN(timestamp) as oldest_record,
    MAX(timestamp) as newest_record,
    COUNT(DISTINCT date(timestamp)) as days_tracked
FROM file_changes;"

# Top directories by activity
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "
SELECT 
    substr(filepath, 1, instr(filepath || '/', '/', instr(filepath, '/', 2) + 1) - 1) as directory,
    COUNT(*) as changes
FROM file_changes 
WHERE datetime(timestamp) >= datetime('now', '-7 days')
GROUP BY directory 
ORDER BY changes DESC 
LIMIT 10;"
```

## Enhanced Troubleshooting

### Monitor doesn't detect changes

1. **Check enhanced status with full diagnostics:**
   ```bash
   ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh status
   ```

2. **Check enhanced logs with timestamps:**
   ```bash
   ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh logs
   tail -f ~/Logs/folder_launchd_error.log
   ```

3. **Test with time-specific recent command:**
   ```bash
   ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh recent 1    # Last hour only
   ```

4. **Restart service:**
   ```bash
   ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh restart
   ```

### Enhanced Diagnostics Script

Run the enhanced diagnostics script to troubleshoot issues:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/siathalysedI/folder-file-monitor/main/folder-file-monitor-diagnostics.sh | bash
```

### Permission or Database Issues

```bash
# Check script permissions
ls -la ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh
chmod +x ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh

# Check database permissions and integrity
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
sqlite3 ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.db "PRAGMA table_info(file_changes);"

# Check log file permissions
ls -la ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.log
```

## Uninstallation

```bash
# 1. Stop and unload service
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.folder.filemonitor.plist

# 2. Remove all files
rm -f ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.folder.filemonitor.plist
rm -f ~/Scripts/folder_file_monitor.sh
rm -f ~/.folder_monitor_config
rm -f ~/Logs/folder_file_monitor.*
rm -f ~/Logs/folder_launchd.*

# 3. Clean empty directories
rmdir ~/Scripts 2>/dev/null || true
rmdir ~/Logs 2>/dev/null || true
```
